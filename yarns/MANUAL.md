### New layouts
- `22` 3-part layout: one two-voice polyphonic part, two monophonic parts
- `21` 2-part layout: 2-voice polyphonic part, monophonic part with modulation output
- `*2` 3-part layout: 3-voice paraphonic part, 1 monophonic part with modulation, 1 monophonic part without modulation
  - Paraphonic part uses amplitude envelopes, configured via the `▽📉 (ENVELOPE MENU)`
  - Audio mode is always on for the paraphonic part
  - Output channels:
    1. Part 1, 3 voices mixed to 1 audio output
    2. Part 2, monophonic CV/gate
    3. Part 2, modulation configurable via `3>`
    4. Part 3, monophonic CV/gate
    
### Global control and display of the active part and its play mode
- Display periodically flashes the active part and its play mode (while in the parameter menu)
- Hold `START` to switch the active part (the new active part will flash briefly on the screen).  The active part is used for:
  - Selecting the recording part when pressing `REC`
  - Front-panel latching (hold `REC`)
  - Editing part-specific settings
- Hold/long-press `TAP` to switch the play mode for the active part (the new play mode will flash).  Play modes are:
  - **`M`anual**: Output is generated by the MIDI controller only
  - **`R`ecord**: Output is generated by the sequencer (and by the MIDI controller depending on `SI (SEQUENCER INPUT RESPONSE)` -- see below)
  - **`A`rpeggiator**: Output is generated by the sequencer-driven arpeggiator (see below)

### Looper with real-time recording
- To enable, ensure `RQ (RECORD TIME QUANTIZATION)` is set to `LOOP`
- To record or overdub, press `REC` to enter real-time recording mode, then use the keyboard
- While in recording mode, press `START` to delete the oldest note, `TAP` for newest note
- Uses the bar as its time basis: loop duration = notes per bar (as set by `B-`) multiplied by quarter note length (as set by `C/`) 
- 16-bit time resolution: ¹⁄₆₅₅₃₆th of the bar
- Can be used to "clock" the arpeggiator
- Holds 16 notes max -- past this limit, overwrites oldest note
- Step sequencer also reduced from 64 to 16 notes, to free up space in the preset storage

### Oscillator PWM
  - Replaced the "25% rectangle" wave with a pulse-width modulated rectangle wave
  - The modulating LFO for the PWM is the quadrature of the vibrato LFO
  - `OSC PW INITIAL` sets initial pulse width
  - `OSC PW MOD` sets the depth of pulse width modulation by the LFO

### More control over MIDI input
- New `SU(STAIN MODE)` setting to change the part's response to the sustain pedal (`NORMAL`, `LATCH`, `MOMENTARY LATCH`, `OFF`)
  - `NORMAL` is default sustain behavior (no notes are released as long as the pedal is pressed)
  - `LATCH` uses the semantics of the front-panel latching in stock Yarns
  - `MOMENTARY LATCH` is identical to `LATCH`, except that it releases latched notes as soon as the pedal is released, instead of on the next note
  - `OFF` ignores the pedal
- New `SI (SEQUENCER INPUT RESPONSE)` setting to change how a playing sequence responds to with keyboard input (`TRANSPOSE`, `REPLACE`, `DIRECT`, `OFF`)
  - `REPLACE` retains the sequence's rhythm, but overrides its pitch
  - `DIRECT` gives full use of the keyboard, allowing accompaniment of a sequence, etc.
- New `IT (INPUT TRANSPOSE OCTAVES)` setting to apply transposition to MIDI signals received by a part
  - Effectively an octave switch for the input device
  - Ignored when using the step to control arpeggiator movement

### Sequencer-driven arpeggiator
- Arpeggiator is now driven by the looper/sequencer instead of being clocked directly -- a sequence must exist to produce arpeggiator output
- The arpeggiator respects rests/ties in the sequence
- The velocity of the arpeggiator output is the product of the velocities of the sequencer step and the held key
- New arpeggiator directions with non-linear movement:
  - Steps are interpreted based on key color and distance above/below middle C
  - `ROTATE` treats white keys as relative movement through the chord, and black keys as absolute positions in the chord
  - `SUBROTATE` generates quasi-cartesian patterns
  
### Velocity filtering
- Added UI for previously unexposed settings `V> (VELOCITY MIN)` and `V< (VELOCITY MAX)`
- Present for all layouts except 4V
- Output velocity range is scaled to compensate for the restricted range imposed by input filtering
  
### More control over vibrato
- New setting `VC (VIBRATO CONTROL SOURCE)` that allows changing the vibrato controller from the default `MODWHEEL` to `AFTERTOUCH`
- New setting `VI(BRATO AMP INITIAL)` for setting a baseline vibrato amplitude when the vibrato controller is absent or at its minimum
- Tweaks to per-voice vibrato LFO for parts in polyphonic layouts:
  - When vibrato speed is synced to clock, each voice's LFO uses the quadrature of the previous voice
  - When vibrato speed is free-running, each voice's LFO frequency is slighter higher than the previous voice
  
### Changes to behavior while a part is recording
- Part now responds to MIDI start
- Flash note (or RS/TI) for the selected step
- Brighten display while the selected step is being played
- Wrap around around when using encoder to scroll through steps
- Allow other parts on the same channel to keep accepting input IFF both the recording part and the accepting part are using velocity filtering

### Tap tempo changes
- If a single tap is received without follow-up, the tempo is set to use external clocking
- After setting a tempo, the result flashes on the screen

### Interface tweaks
- Moved configuration-type settings into a submenu, accessed by opening `▽S (SETUP MENU)`.  Settings relevant to live performance remain in the top-level menu
- Changes to interface while recording:
  - Hold `REC` to clear sequence
  - First `REC` press switches the display to show the pitch instead of the step number (press again to exit recording)
- Print flat notes as lowercase character (instead of denoting flatness with `b`) so that octave can always be displayed

### Other tweaks
- Fixed `UNISON` voice allocation methods to respect `NOTE PRIORITY` and allocate notes without gaps; added new `FIRST` setting to `NOTE PRIORITY`
- Voicing algorithms `UNISON 2` and `SORTED` reassign voices on `NoteOff` if there are held notes that don't yet have a voice
- Broaden portamento setting range from 51 to 64 values per curve shape
