# Loom
An alternative firmware for the [Yarns MIDI interface by Mutable Instruments](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/yarns/).

### Objectives
- Enhance Yarns as a tool for solo and collaborative musical composition
- Obtain maximal functionality from a minimal MIDI controller
- Expand Yarns' abilities as a digital synthesis voice

### Features
- [New layouts, including a layout that features a 3-voice paraphonic part](yarns/MANUAL.md#layouts)
- [Global control and display of the active part and its play mode](yarns/MANUAL.md#global-control-and-display-of-the-active-part-and-its-play-mode)
- [Looper with real-time recording and overdubbing](https://github.com/rcrogers/yarns-loom/blob/loom-testing/yarns/MANUAL.md#looper-style-sequencing-mode-with-real-time-recording)
- [Sequencer-driven arpeggiator](https://github.com/rcrogers/yarns-loom/blob/loom-testing/yarns/MANUAL.md#sequencer-driven-arpeggiator)
- [Internal envelopes, with velocity-modulated segments and amplitude](yarns/MANUAL.md#adsr-envelopes-modulated-by-velocity)
- [Pulse-width modulation for Yarns' digital oscillator](https://github.com/rcrogers/yarns-loom/blob/loom-testing/yarns/MANUAL.md#oscillator-controls)
- [Velocity filtering](https://github.com/rcrogers/yarns-loom/blob/loom-testing/yarns/MANUAL.md#event-routing-filtering-and-transformation)
- [More control over vibrato, input octave, sustain behavior, and sequencer/keyboard interaction](https://github.com/rcrogers/yarns-loom/blob/loom-testing/yarns/MANUAL.md#event-routing-filtering-and-transformation)
- [New ways to use the hold pedal, including latch and sostenuto](https://github.com/rcrogers/yarns-loom/blob/loom-testing/yarns/MANUAL.md#hold-pedal)
- [Expanded CC support, including start/stop/delete recording](https://github.com/rcrogers/yarns-loom/blob/loom-testing/yarns/MANUAL.md#expanded-support-for-control-change-events)
- [Check the manual for more!](yarns/MANUAL.md)

### Caveats
- Installation of this firmware is at your own risk
- Presets saved in this firmware cannot be loaded with the manufacturer's firmware, and vice versa
- Some changes are not documented in the changelog
- Some of Yarns' stock capabilities have been downgraded to accomodate new features (e.g. the sequencer holds 16 notes instead of the original 64)

### Installation
1. Download `yarns.syx` from the [latest release's assets](https://github.com/rcrogers/mutable-instruments-eurorack/releases/latest)
2. [Follow the manufacturer's instructions for installing new firmware](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/yarns/manual/#firmware)
